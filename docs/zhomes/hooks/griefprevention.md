# GriefPrevention

## What's GriefPrevention?

[**GriefPrevention**](https://modrinth.com/plugin/griefprevention) is a user-friendly and highly effective plugin designed to stop griefing before it happens. It allows players to protect their builds with simple tools—usually just a golden shovel—by claiming land and preventing unwanted edits from others. Claims are automatically protected from block breaking, chest access, mob damage, and more, with minimal setup required. Server owners can customize rules per world, adjust claim limits, and define trusted players for shared building. GriefPrevention is ideal for survival servers, promoting fairness and creativity without needing complex commands or heavy moderation.

## What's if used for in the plugin?

It's used to prevent players from setting homes inside land claims they don’t own or have AccessTrust in.
