# WorldGuard

## What's WorldGuard?

[**WorldGuard**](https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldguard) is a powerful and widely-used plugin that allows server owners to protect specific areas of the world and control gameplay behavior within them. It works seamlessly with [**WorldEdit**](https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldedit) to let you define regions, then apply flags to customize what players can or can't do—like blocking PvP, preventing mob spawning, or denying access entirely. It’s highly configurable and supports per-player, group, and region-based permissions. With [**WorldGuard**](https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldguard), you can easily safeguard builds, manage server rules, and create custom experiences on your Minecraft server.
