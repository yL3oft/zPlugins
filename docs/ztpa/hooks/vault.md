# Vault

## What's Vault?

[**Vault**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) is an essential plugin that acts as a bridge between different economy, permissions, and chat plugins. It provides a unified API so developers can support multiple systems without hardcoding compatibility. With Vault installed, plugins can easily hook into your server’s chosen economy (like [**EssentialsX**](https://modrinth.com/plugin/essentialsx) or [**CMI**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmi-300-commands-insane-kits-portals-essentials-economy-mysql-sqlite-much-more.3742/)), permissions (like [**LuckPerms**](https://luckperms.net/download)), or chat formatting system. It’s a behind-the-scenes powerhouse that ensures smooth communication between plugins and keeps your server running seamlessly.
