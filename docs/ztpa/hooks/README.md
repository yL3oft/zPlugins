# Hooks

## What's a Hook?

A **hook** is a way for the plugin to work together with other plugins. It lets the plugin use features from those other plugins to do more things, like showing extra info or adding new options. Hooks help everything run smoothly together without needing to set it all up by hand.

## All Plugin Hooks:

{% content-ref url="worldguard.md" %}
[worldguard.md](worldguard.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="vault.md" %}
[vault.md](vault.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
